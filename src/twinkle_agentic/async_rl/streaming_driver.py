"""Algorithm-agnostic per-sample streaming control flow for online RL.

:class:`StreamingDriver` replaces the retired batch-granular deep-buffer skeleton with a per-sample one:
trajectories are
admitted ONE AT A TIME (each an independent sampler submission), completions are polled as-completed
into an in-process ready buffer, and the consumer trains WHATEVER IS READY instead of waiting for a
fixed batch to finish together. A slot freed by a completion is immediately backfilled from the prompt
stream, so the engine stays loaded and no straggler tail idles it -- at every staleness setting.

sync and async are not separate code paths here: they are points on the ``max_staleness`` knob of the
injected :class:`~twinkle_agentic.async_rl.context_manager.RLContextManager` (0 = synchronous: the
admission window closes while its samples train; 1 = one-step overlap; >1 = deep buffer). The driver
never branches on the regime.

Control-plane mapping (the load-bearing design decision):

* ONE PARTITION = ONE PUBLISH CYCLE = ``parameter_sync_step`` optimizer steps. A partition does NOT
  declare fixed members -- it is an admission WINDOW opened via ``request_rollout_partition`` (which is
  where the staleness gate lives: at most ``max_staleness + 1`` windows live at once) and closed by the
  publish that ends its cycle. Samples flow through the shared ready buffer in completion order, so a
  straggler never blocks a window: it lands in a later one and, if by then its version lag exceeds
  ``max_staleness``, the post-publish stale scan drops it.
* The POLICY VERSION bumps once per publish (``on_partition_trained``), never per optimizer step, so a
  sample's lag (``current_version - record.version``) is measured in publish cycles under
  ``parameter_sync_step = K`` exactly as ``max_staleness`` is defined. Windows are published oldest-live
  first, which satisfies ``on_partition_training_started``'s FIFO requirement because windows open (and
  therefore age) in step order.
* Backpressure is a sample-count cap, ``buffer_depth``: admission pauses while
  ``in_flight + ready >= buffer_depth``. The consumer sizes the cap so one window's fill
  (``groups_per_partition * num_generations``) is at least one full training pull -- otherwise the
  driver could deadlock with a buffer too shallow to assemble a batch while admission is capped.

Injected seams (the external contract a consumer wires up; the driver knows no algorithm):

* ``submit(prompt_idx, trajectory_idx, policy) -> handle``: admit ONE trajectory without blocking,
  pinned to ``policy`` (its ``adapter_path`` travels with the submission under snapshot publication;
  ``None`` under in-place).
* ``poll(handles) -> completed_handles``: non-blocking as-completed query over the in-flight handles
  (a subset of ``handles``; unknown values are ignored).
* ``collect(handle) -> sample``: fetch one completed trajectory's training sample.
* ``assembly_ready(buffer) -> Optional[List[BufferRecord]]``: the algorithm-specific pull rule --
  inspect the ready buffer and, when it holds at least one full training unit (GRPO/RFT: whole groups,
  since every sibling of a group is admitted together under one policy and therefore shares ONE
  version, so a group is complete or untrainable; PPO/GKD: individual samples), remove and return
  exactly the records of one batch (an exact multiple of the consumer's optimizer-step batch, so the
  exact-global-batch invariant holds); ``None`` when not ready. Records left over stay buffered.
* ``consume(records) -> Optional[int]``: score and train the pulled batch (the existing
  ``_train_rollout_batch`` half of a dev loop). Returns the number of OPTIMIZER STEPS it ran (a falsy
  or ``None`` return counts as one), which drives the publish cadence.
* ``cancel(handle)``: drop an in-flight generation (budget hit, drain, or error).
* ``publish``: the injected :class:`~twinkle_agentic.async_rl.weight_sync.WeightSyncStrategy`;
  ``publish(admission)`` returns the new version's pinning handle (a path, or ``None`` for in-place).
* ``group_key(prompt_idx) -> str`` (optional): the training-group identifier stamped on every
  trajectory of one prompt (default ``str(prompt_idx)``).
* ``prune()`` (optional): drop published artifacts no live version and no in-flight pin reference.
* ``initial_adapter_path()`` (optional): the version-0 pin (the pre-training adapter path for
  snapshot publication, ``None`` for in-place).
* ``reached_max()`` (optional): whether the optimizer-step budget is exhausted.
* ``sleep(seconds)`` (optional): idle wait injected for testability; defaults to ``time.sleep``.

Staleness enforcement: a record's version lag is bounded at TWO points, both counted in
``stats.dropped_stale`` (a dropped record's pin was already released at collect). (1) AT COLLECT: a
straggler can stay in flight across more than ``max_staleness`` publishes -- the post-publish scan never
sees the in-flight set -- so a completion is dropped the moment it is fetched if its lag already exceeds
the bound. This is what keeps a late arrival from ENTERING the buffer untrainable and being consumed
stale before the next scan could catch it. (2) AFTER EVERY PUBLISH: the buffer is scanned and each record
whose lag now exceeds ``max_staleness`` is dropped, covering records that aged past the bound while
buffered. Dropping is per-record but sound for group consumers: siblings share one version (admitted
back-to-back under one policy), so a stale group is dropped whole -- at collect and/or across a scan --
and ``assembly_ready`` never pulls an incomplete group, so no unusable record survives past one publish
cycle.

Drain: when the prompt stream is exhausted, admission stops, in-flight generations are polled to
completion (blocking via ``sleep`` between polls), the consumer keeps training the ready buffer until
``assembly_ready`` declines, and then whatever remains (an incomplete group, or a remainder below one
full batch) is dropped and counted -- there is no future batch to carry it into. Every window still
live is cleared. A budget hit (``reached_max``) or an error instead cancels every STILL-in-flight
submission (releasing its pin), and clears every window in the ``finally``, leaking nothing.
